    "# 🤔 Why are you here?\n",
    "\n",
    "You're likely here because you've heard of, or directly seen, the amazing things happening in the AI space using Large Language Model (LLM) AI. The best way to learn something new is to have a hands-on learning experience — this GitHub repo will let you do some of that, we hope. Semantic Kernel (SK) is an open-source project to be intentionally inclusive of folks at all levels of capability so that the productivity benefits of LLM AI can be more accessible to everyone. SK's been created to make it easy for folks to add LLM AI to your app without a deep background in computer programming. If this sounds like you, then you've definitely at the right place.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1. Building with Semantic Kernel is like cooking 🧂🥑🍋🔥\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the inspirations for Semantic Kernel's conceptual design is the NYT bestselling cook book by Samin Nosrat entitled, [\"Salt Fat Acid Heat\"](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/26/t-magazine/samin-nosrat-salt-fat-acid-heat-most-prized-possession.html) and star of [the mini-series](https://www.netflix.com/title/80198288) of the same name on Netflix. Nosrat lays out four key elements to all successful cooked meals as carefully integrating:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. 🧂 Salt: Core and essential\n",
    "2. 🥑 Fat: Rich and full-bodied\n",
    "3. 🍋 Acid: Fresh and zesty\n",
    "4. 🔥 Heat: Powerful and alchemy\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, think of the popular dish \"avocado toast\" and how important the quality of 🧂 salt, 🥑 fat, 🍋 acid, and 🔥 heat can be to that breakfast staple. \n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. The four ingredients to making delicious AI experiences\n",
    "\n",
    "Like Nosrat's special recipe for cooking a great meal, SK has four key elements for using LLMs to cook terrific AI experiences:\n",
    "\n",
    "| 🍽️ Analogue | SK Term | Description of \"Ingredient\" |\n",
    "|---|---|---|\n",
    "| 🧂 Salt | SKILLS | 🧂 Core LLM AI building blocks that can be stored and reused |\n",
    "| 🥑 Fat | MEMORIES | 🥑Rich contextual info to level-up LLM AI prompts |\n",
    "| 🍋 Acid | CONNECTORS | 🍋 Fresh, realtime data and capabilities for zesty LLM AI |\n",
    "| 🔥 Heat | KERNEL | 🔥 Powerful convection oven of the LLM AI Asks. Watch the temperature!  |\n"

    "When you are \"cooking\" with Semantic Kernel, you can do so from within the app you're building. But you may want to just play a bit in the kitchen to start. These `.ipynb` notebooks are able to function as both a reading experience and as a coding experience. The text blocks don't do anything; the code blocks do.\n",

    "* When you load a `.ipynb` file in VS Code for the first time, be sure to start at the top and make your way through to the bottom sequentially. That's because the notebook  is in your complete control.\n",
    "* When you come back to a `.ipynb` file or open it and scroll to the very bottom of the file, keep in mind that it may want you to start back from the top again. It doesn't do anything automatically.\n",
