    "When people ask me why Semantic Kernel has its slightly odd name, the simple and truthful answer is that the initial conceiver of SK, Deputy CTO of Microsoft Sam Schillace, has been a long admirer of the simplicity of the UNIX kernel. UNIX was a radical departure in operating systems for its simplicity and flexibility — especially when it came to a concept called \"pipes.\" UNIX commands were easy to string together into a chain reaction like:\n",
