## üèÅ Prerequisites to getting started with the notebooks in this repo

> üëã New to GitHub and VS Code? [Beginner instructions are at the üëábottom.](https://github.com/johnmaeda/SK-How-Tos#-never-used-github-or-visual-studio-code-before-no-problem-weve-got-you)

Software that needs to be installed on your computer:

* ‚úÖ [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/Download)
* ‚úÖ The latest [.Net 7.0 SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download) 
* ‚úÖ [Polyglot Notebooks for VS Code](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-dotnettools.dotnet-interactive-vscode)

When the three items above are installed, this notebook should be formatted nicely with code blocks that have a little ‚ñ∂Ô∏è (play) button next to them. This lets you run the code from within Visual Studio Code and serves as a little playground for your initial Semantic Kernel learnings.

Separate from installing software, you will need to have an API key to access the OpenAI models. 

* ‚úÖ OpenAI key via [OpenAI](https://openai.com/product) or [Azure OpenAI Service](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cognitive-services/openai/quickstart). Access your API key on OpenAI with [these instructions](https://help.openai.com/en/articles/4936850-where-do-i-find-my-secret-api-key), or on Azure Open AI Service with [these instructions](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cognitive-services/openai/reference).
