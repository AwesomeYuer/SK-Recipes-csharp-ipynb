This is a collection of .ipnyb files that are to be run locally with the following requirements:

## üèÅ Prerequisites to getting started with the notebooks in this repo

Software that needs to be installed on your computer:

* ‚úÖ [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/Download)
* ‚úÖ The latest [.Net 7.0 SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download) 
* ‚úÖ [Polyglot Notebooks for VS Code](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-dotnettools.dotnet-interactive-vscode)

When the three items above are installed, this notebook should be formatted nicely with code blocks that have a little ‚ñ∂Ô∏è (play) button next to them. This lets you run the code from within Visual Studio Code and serves as a little playground for your initial Semantic Kernel leranings.

Separate from installing software, you will need to have an API key to access the OpenAI models. 

* ‚úÖ OpenAI key via [OpenAI](https://openai.com/product) or [Azure OpenAI Service](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cognitive-services/openai/quickstart)
