This repo is a collection of `.ipynb` (aka "Jupyter notebook") files to be run locally from VS Code with the following requirements:

## üèÅ Prerequisites to getting started with the notebooks in this repo

> üò± New to GitHub and VS Code? [Beginner instructions are over here.](THE-BASICS.md)

Software that needs to be installed on your computer:

* ‚úÖ [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/Download)
* ‚úÖ The latest [.Net 7.0 SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download) 
* ‚úÖ [Polyglot Notebooks for VS Code](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-dotnettools.dotnet-interactive-vscode)

When the three items above are installed, this notebook should be formatted nicely with code blocks that have a little ‚ñ∂Ô∏è (play) button next to them when you hover over the code. The "Polyglot Notebooks for VS Code" extension is what lets you run all the code snippets from within VS Code and serves as a little playground for your initial Semantic Kernel learnings.

Separate from installing software, you will need to have an API key to access the OpenAI models. 

* ‚úÖ OpenAI key via [OpenAI](https://openai.com/product) or [Azure OpenAI Service](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cognitive-services/openai/quickstart). Access your API key on OpenAI with [these instructions](https://help.openai.com/en/articles/4936850-where-do-i-find-my-secret-api-key), or on Azure Open AI Service with [these instructions](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cognitive-services/openai/reference).
